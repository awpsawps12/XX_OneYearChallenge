*** DONE Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes
    CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:20]
Human has two modes of thinking, /focused/ and /diffuse/ modes.

The *Focus Mode* is the type of intense concentration people need to work through a problem, step by step. 

The *Diffuse Mode* of thinking is used to learn new idea, it could be thought of as a flashlight set so that it casts its light very broadly, but not very strong in any one area.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   You must also plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work.
#+END_QUOTE

The travel distance is the key to differentiate two mode of thinking.

Human can only think in *one* mode at a time.

Use the analogy of the game of pinball, diffuse mode of thinking is like widely spaced rubber bumpers and focused model of thinking is like closed placed rubber bumpers.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The diffuse mode could be thought of as a flashlight set so that it casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in one area. (As opposed to the focused mode, which would have its light cast very strongly in a single area, but very weakly everywhere else.)

*** DONE Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley: Introduction to the Course Structure
    CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:20]

The course is help student reframe how to thing about learning and to help reduce frustration and increase understanding. Student is not required to have any in-depth background in particular subject, but students are expected to take the ideas and apply them to whatever subject the student is trying to learn and improve in.

It is important to learn "how to learn" because it is easy to fool yourself about whether you actually know the material. The course teach new ways to hold your focus and embed the material in mind. The course also covers tips to overcome procrastination with less frustration.

*** DONE Welcome to Learning How to Learn!
    CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:20]

This section covers course objectives, FAQs, forums usage, grade calcuations, recommand readings, etc.

*** DONE Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes
    CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:25]

How to switch between focused mode and diffused mode (Use by "famous people")?

Traditional techniques to connect between two mode of thinking is to wake up just before falling asleep. Let the mind changing between two modes can help learning effectively.

Switching between the focused and diffuse modes helps people to learn hard things and learning difficult thing takes time. It is like doing excise, do little bit every day.

Metaphors provide power techniques for learning.

*** DONE What is Learning
    CLOSED: [2016-11-14 Mon 11:26]

The brain is complex. There are a million billion synapses in the bran. Many new synapses (conections) are formed on the dendrites when you learn new things.

 #+BEGIN_QUOTE

 Procrastination is a way of brain to avoid the pain by switching attention to something else,

 1. Unhappy feeling
 2. Funnel attention onto a more pleasant task
 3. Fell happy temporarily

 Pomodoro is a great tool/technique to fix procrastination, usually it is a period of time (25 minutes) uninterrupted focused time with reward at end of each period.

*** DONE Practice Makes Permanent
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:02]

 It is important to practice with ideas and concepts when learning math and science to help enhance and strength the neural connection during the learning process because these concepts are abstract.

 In other words, it is possible to change and become accomplished in areas that you don't think you can do very well at.

*** DONE Introduction to Memory
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:04]

 Introducing two major memory in the memory systems, *long-term memory* and *working memory*. These two memory are related. Working memory has four (4) chunks.

*Focus mode* is associated with the concentrating abilities of the brains' prefrontal cortex.

#+DOWNLOADED: .//Users/li-xinyang/Desktop/Week 01.qvnote/resources/131591AA3A98D35116B6AD61C587BFCD.png @ 2016-11-11 07:57:28

 Short-term memory is like inefficient blackboard (Not very good one) but longterm memory is like warehouse distributed in a big/wide area. It is important because it is the place where fundamental concepts and techniques are stored.

 Moving things from working memory to longterm memory takes time and practice.

*** DONE The Importance of Sleep in Learning
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:16]

The space between brain cells increase when you sleep because it shrink during sleeping. Fluid flow past cells and wach the toxins (Metabolic toxins) out.

That is why sleeping is a good way to keep brain clean and healthy and it is an important part of learning.

During sleep, brain erases the less important parts of memories and strengthens areas that you need/want to remember.

    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:16]

Key points get from Dr. Terrence are listed below.

Learning by doing and learning from the experts. Multi-task is not doing two things at the same time but quick context switching ability.

Asking question (Interaction) and discussion is interesting when the topic is dry. You can learn more by active engagement rather than
passive listening.

Muti-task is not possible but it is a key skill (Key to accomplishing a lot task/thing) to quick switch between contexts (Different tasks).

*** DONE Summary video for Module 1
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:16]
This week introduced two mode of thinking (Many modes), *focused* (Helps to keep concentrated) and *diffuse* (Learning new things).

"Smart" people can access the diffuse model more easily. 

The easiest way to overcome procrastination is to use Pomodoro technique. 

Practice can move working memory into long term memory.

Sleep and exerice make learning more effectively.

**** DONE Notes on Note-Taking
     CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:18]
Review of research highlights for students and instructors from Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching. (Instructor part of note-taking skill is ignored for now)

http://hilt.harvard.edu/files/hilt/files/notetaking_0.pdf

Notes are key tool for learning. Good skill makes learning process more efficient (advancing learning, memory, long-term retention of content).

Tips for note-taking,

1. Take generative notes (Use your own words)
2. Review early and often
3. Test yourself (Flashcard/Cornell Notes)
4. +Carefully consider how you want to take notes+ (Pen/Laptop)
5. Be careful of misperceptions during learning (Avoid the misperception that you know lecture content better than you actually do which leads to poor study habits. Be aware you will forget learned things and adopt study habits to address the gaps in knowledge)

Production and review notes is part of learning process which making connection between idea unit and course content. It also helps solving problems and making decisions. It is not benefit to all for example clinical counseling).

Keep the focus on learning first. Otherwise, taking a class become a transcription event instead of a *learning event*. It is hard to find the balance between production and learning. To solve the issue, one way is to write note in stenography/shorthand.

Note quality is hard to assess because it is self-produced records. However, researcher use number of idea units, key lecture points to assess the quality. (Some researcher argued that the highest quality/most effective notes are those that can be understood by someone unfamiliar with notes content)

*Optimal method of note-taking* is a to using a framework/organization and generative activities (Self testing) to facilitate the connections between ideas and making multiple times reviews.

Two note-taking styles, *linear* and *non-linear*. Cornell Notes format splits a note into different sections. Left side for the formal note, right side for the question, and bottom is the summary of the page. Cornell formats helps connect ideas, synthesize information and better apply knowledge to novel context.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Managing working memory is an essential component for effective note-taking.
#+END_QUOTE

*Optimal method for notes reviewing*, note reviewing is the largest benefits from note-taking. Self-testing using either flashcard or Cornell methods. Do it early and often is also another good habit to have.

What is chunk?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Chunks are pieces of information, through bound together through meaning of use. A network of neurons that are used to firing together.
#+END_QUOTE

Brand new concepts can make less sense, but chunk make these small pieces of information more meaningful. Chunk helps to connect pieces through meaning and provides a big picture. (The logical whole, many connected chunks) Single piece of information without context does not provide much values.

Create conceptual chunks is the first step to learning anything, which unite scattered bits of information through meaning.

The concept of chunk can be apply to many fields, focus and practice helps to create chunks which helps brain run more efficiently. Any expertise is built little by little. The underlying details become passive when you master all the related chunks.

*** DONE How to Form a Chunk - Part 1
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:24]

Form a chunk is about to find the pattern and to build larger chunk based on the mini chunk. (Like languages is learned bit by bit)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained, that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together.
#+END_QUOTE

Learning things with workout example is easy, but make sure you are not only putting the focus on the purpose of each step but also the connection between each step (Why each step is there).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It's more like using a road map to help you when traveling to a new place. Pay attention to what's going on around you when you're using the map, and soon you'll find yourself about to get there on your own. You'll even be able to figure out new ways of getting there.
#+END_QUOTE

*** DONE How to Form a Chunk - Part 2
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:26]

strategy of forming chunk for different fields are different. The steps are,

1. Focus on chunking new material
2. Understand the chunking ideas (Like glue links other chunks)
3. Practice (Gaining context, knows how and when to use the chunk)

Test on formed chunk (Only DIY can master the chunk). 

Easily accessible chunks can be built by practice and reputation (Bottom up learning approach). Another approach is top down learning (A big picture approach), for example, skim through the content you are about to learn.

Context is where top down and bottom up meet, so you know when to use chunks.

*** DONE Illusions of Competence
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:27]

This section covers /recall/, /illusions of competence/, /mini-testing/, and /value of making mistakes/.

Base on research, rereading is much less productive than recall. You can learn more deeper by practicing and recalling. In other word, passive learning is the last learning option you want to choose. Recalling covert working memory into hyper link which connect to other chunks in other part of the brain.

Different surrounding can also enhance learning while recalling.

Illusion of competence is like looking at the problem solution and think you have known how to solve the problem. (Highlighting should be done carefully!) Synthesize key ideas/concepts are very good idea.

Self testing and recall can ensure you have master the material. Mistake can helps to learn better.

This sections covers how brain works related to motivation. Learning can be easy when you passionate about it (or certain fields). 

What really motivates your is some kind of stuff.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Dopamine is in the business of predicting future rewards and not just the immediate reward. 

This can motivate you to do something that may not be rewarding right now but will lead to a much better reward in the future. 
#+END_QUOTE

This sections discussed three (3) neuromodulators,

- acetylcholine, affects focused learning and attention
- dopamine, predict future rewards and not the immediate reward
- serotonin, affect risk taking behavior

*** DONE The Value of a Library of Chunks
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:30]

The bigger and well practiced the chunk of mental library the likely to become an expertise in certain area (Regardless the fields).

Chunks in one field can *transfer* to chunks in other fields. The problem can be quickly solved if you have a well built library of chunks. Building chunk is a way to training the brain to find patterns.

Two way to solve problem,

- Sequential, involve focused mode
- Holistic Intuition, involve creative diffused mode linking to focused mode throughts (May not always correct)

Law of Serendipity,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

Just focus the current section/unit you are trying to learn without worry to much about other related concepts/material which makes your next learning step easier to process.

*** DONE Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:31]

You may tend to practice one thing repetitively when you learn new thing. It is called overleaning. It does benefit to some area but not all. For other fields, it just waste of learning time.

*Deliberate practice* is to intentionally focus on things that you are not mastered yet.

*Einstellung* (German word, /minset/), a great built chunk may prevent you to find the solution in focused mode.

Related information helps to solve your facing issue, research before starting solving issue.

*Interleaving*, practicing jumping back and forth between problems/situation that require different techniques or strategies. (Mix up the learning process and train the brain not only how to solve a problem but when to use certain technique, kind like shuffle the cards) It builds and enhance creativity and flexibility.

This section compares two kind of people, expertise in one field and expertise in multiple fields. First group create new things but second group knows the field better/deeper.

*** DONE Summary
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:32]
    
Chunks related information bound via usage and meaning. Big chunk can build upon small chunk. It can be built through focus, understanding, and practice. Recall in different physical place is the good way to enhance the chunk. Transfer helps to use chunk in other fields.

This module also covers illusion of competence, deliberate practice, einstellung (mindset, prevent you to be flexible) and /Law of Serendipity/ (Lady luck favors the one who tries).

This module cover procrastination and memory. These two concepts are related because converting working memory to long-term memory takes time and should *NEVER* put until "the last minute".

This module also cover how to overcome with procrastination with the minilist efforts and a way to best access your brain's long-term memory.

*** DONE Tackling Procrastination - It's Easier, and More Valuable, Than You Think
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:34]

Understand procrastination can help to prevent it from happening. Inner "Zombie" is used to illustrate your brain falls into as a result of specific cues (To make here and now better).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Good learning is a bit by bit activity. You want to avoid cramming which doesn't build solid neural structures.
#+END_QUOTE

Willpower uses lot of neural resources and should not be used to against procrastination.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Procrastination can be a single monumentally important keystone bad habit, a habit in other words that influences many important areas of your life.
#+END_QUOTE

Procrastination always come with "self story telling" (Making excuses for procrastination) and can be extreamly dangerous (Arsenic eaters example, 48th meeting of the German Association of Arts and Science), it harms you bit by bit. It shares common features with addiction.

Next few sections will train you how to master your own habits.

*** DONE Zombies Everywhere
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:35]

Chunking related to habit and habit (Zombie mode, you do not need to put all your attention to one thing) is energy saver. There are four(4) parts which consist habit,

1. The cue, the trigger put you into the zombie mode (It can be harmful or helpful)
2. The routine, your habit (Zombie mode)
3. The reward, habit continues because of reward/pleasant
4. The belief, your underline belief

*** DONE Surf's Up: Process Versus Product
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:37]

Mental tools/tricks can make learning process effectively. 

The first trick is to focus on the *process* instead of *product*. Usually the product is the trigger that cause the procrastination.

The key point is to put your best effort in a period of time (Process), but not on the outcome (Production).

Distribution sometime can be hard to avoid but it is nice to avoid it and train yourself so that you can switch the mental context quickly.

*** DONE Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:40]

This sections is about harnessing zombie powers of habit to help avoiding procrastination with minimalist use of willpower.

The only place should apply willpower is the change the *cue* (Mentioned in the previous section).

(1) The *cue* falls into four (4) categories,

- Location
- Time
- How you feel
- Reactions

(2) The *routine*, the key to rewire habit (Change habit) is /plan/.

(3) The *reward*, this require some investigation on why you are procrastination and substitute an emotional payoff.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The better you good at something, the more enjoyable it can become.

(4) The *belief*, habit is the belief that you can do it.

*** DONE Juggling Life and Learning
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:41]

List down all the pending tasks to free space in working memory for problem solving. It is also good to list the task before sleep and your brain can help you to figure out how to solve them in background.

Habit of Listing tasks also helps to help you estimate how long you need for certain kind of tasks. The single task should be manageable (Not too big/small). Planing start/end time is also major part of listing tasks technique.

*** DONE Summing Up Procrastination
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:41]

Learning involves bit by bit building of solid neural scaffolds. To sum up,

- Keep a planner journal, check your progress constantly
- Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day, write your daily plan/tasks and review before sleep
- Delay rewards until you finish the task
- Watch for procrastination cues
- Gain trust in your new system (Tasks/Planning system)
- Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate
- Eat your frogs first

    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:43]
    
Memory is not only part of developing expertise but a very *important* part. Human-being has outstanding visual and spatial memory systems to help building /long-term memory/. The special visual memory system is good at "Where the things are?" and "How do they look?". 

To convert working memory to long-term memory, there are few criterias. The idea should be /memorable/, it must be repeated. Handwriting also helps make things memorable by deeply encode the idea into neural memory structure.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
People often underestimate the benefits of spaced repetition when learning.

*** DONE What is Long Term Memory
    CLOSED: [2016-11-15 Tue 10:43]
    
There are multiple memory system for different types of learning. Memory is not fixed, but change all the time. It can be strenged/recalled (Reconsolidation). Consolidation, reconsolidation occurs during sleep. This explain why spaced learning works.

Astrocytes are brain cells that provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extracellular (outside the cell) ion balance, involved in repair after injury and have a role in learning.

Damage to the hippocampus and its input leads to inability to store new long-term memories.

3.  Merely glancing at a problem's solution and thinking you know how to
    do it (One of the worst errors)
4.  Waiting untile the last minute to study
5.  Repeatedly solving problems of the same type that you already know
    how to solve
6.  +Letting study sessions with friends turn into chat sessions+
7.  Neglecting to read the textbook before you start working problems
    (Information guides to solution)
8.  Not checking with instructors or classmates to clear up points of
