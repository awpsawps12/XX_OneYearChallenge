<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I am Li Xinyang (<a href="https://github.com/li-xinyang" class="uri">https://github.com/li-xinyang</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/lixinyang9" class="uri">https://twitter.com/lixinyang9</a>), a Front-end Developers who do not have a computer science degree. I am passionate about technology, however, it is not easy for me when I want to proceed further in my career because of lack of fundamental computer science knowledge. I finally decided to take a challenge, completing four years US Computer Science degree equivalent online courses in just one year.</p>
<p>There are 37 courses in the curriculum. It covers every aspect about computer science. Most of the courses are from Edx and Coursera and I will complete the <strong>verified version</strong> if the course does have one. The study note will be recorded on a daily basis, and I believe I will gain a lot after complete this challenge.</p>
<p>The whole challenge takes about 2653 hours to accomplish.</p>

<h1>Curriculum</h1>
<p>The curriculum used for this challenge is provided by Open Source Society. It is a solid path for those who want to complete a Computer Science course on their own time with courses from the best universities in the world. A completed list of curriculum can be found at link below,</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science" class="uri">https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science</a></p>
<h1>Additional Information</h1>
<p><strong>Foundations of Mathematics</strong></p>
<p>I am also honing the basic math skill at Khan Academy during the challenge. The focuses are on Algebra, Calculus and Statistics &amp; Probability, Geometry and Trigonometry maybe later.</p>
<p>The progress will be updated periodically (Last updated at 29/11/16 and the link seems only visible to me).</p>

<p><strong>Anki</strong></p>
<p>Anki, a flash cards program, is used to supplement the learning process. My learning process for this challenge is,</p>
<ol>
<li>Watch lecture</li>
<li>Take study notes</li>
<li>Convert notes into flashcards</li>
<li>Complete PSET if any</li>
<li>Complete Exam if any</li>
</ol>
<p>Anki can be found at link below,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ankisrs.net/" class="uri">http://www.ankisrs.net/</a></p>
<p>All my cards are highly personalized, hence I will not share them publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Emacs</strong></p>
<p>I use Spacemacs (Emacs configuration kit) to compose everything you see here. You can read more about Spacemacs at link below,</p>
