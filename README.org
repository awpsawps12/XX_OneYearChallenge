* Introduction

I am Li Xinyang (https://github.com/li-xinyang; https://twitter.com/lixinyang9), a Front-end Developers who do not have a computer science degree. I am passionate about technology, however, it is not easy for me when I want to proceed further in my career because of lack of fundamental computer science knowledge. I finally decided to take a challenge, completing four years US Computer Science degree equivalent online courses in just one year.

There are 37 courses in the curriculum. It covers every aspect about computer science. Most of the courses are from Edx and Coursera and I will complete the *verified version* if the course does have one. The study note will be recorded on a daily basis, and I believe I will gain a lot after complete this challenge.

The whole challenge takes about 2653 hours to accomplish.

Study note with =*= at the end indicates that course is worth re-taking after a while.

* Curriculum

The curriculum used for this challenge is provided by Open Source Society. It is a solid path for those who want to complete a Computer Science course on their own time with courses from the best universities in the world. A completed list of curriculum can be found at link below,

* Additional Information

*Foundations of Mathematics*

I am also honing the basic math skill at Khan Academy during the challenge. The focuses are on Algebra, Calculus and Statistics & Probability, Geometry and Trigonometry maybe later. 

The progress will be updated periodically (Last updated at 29/11/16 and the link seems only visible to me).

*Anki*

Anki, a flash cards program, is used to supplement the learning process. My learning process for this challenge is,

1. Watch lecture
2. Take study notes
3. Convert notes into flashcards
4. Complete PSET if any
5. Complete Exam if any

Anki can be found at link below,

All my cards are highly personalized, hence I will not share them publicly.

*Emacs*

I use Spacemacs (Emacs configuration kit) to compose everything you see here. You can read more about Spacemacs at link below,
