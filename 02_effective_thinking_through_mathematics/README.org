#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you want to really learn, the goal is to change yourself, to become a different person.
#+END_QUOTE

Below are five elements of effective thinking,

- Understand deeply, understand simple things deeply with far greater precision, nuance, and depth
- Make mistakes, it is directive
- Raise Questions, it can have profound energizing effect on your inner life
- Follow the flow of ideas
- The quintessential (典型的) element (Change), it is the goal of this course

The strategy of this course is to /participate/ (Active in thinking for yourself). 

** DONE Introduction to the Team
   CLOSED: [2016-12-02 Fri 07:34]

The first teast of /effective thinking/ is to learn how to produce new idea(s) by learn/get from others or rely on the advise of others. In short try to be a producer of knowledge rather than a consumber of knowledge.

Work on an idea with a group is generally better.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Continually pushing yourself to understand things better is an extermely potent method for making yourself more successful.
#+END_QUOTE

If you are honest with yourself about what you actually understand and do NOT understand, you are in the most productive state in your mental life. You make progress when you are in the productive state in your mental life.

In short, *ALWAYS BEING HONEST TO YOURSELF AND OTHERS ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW*, and this will change your life.

   CLOSED: [2016-12-02 Fri 07:41]

It is always better to systematically list all the possibilities and record the mistakes you have had made. The process of eliminate the bad option is also a way to make progress to find the real solution.

It is often easier to start at the exit and trace backwards to the entrance.

One way to solve a problem is to simplify it (Make it into manageable chunks OR ridiculously simple). When you solved the simplifed version, then you can apply the insights to solve more complex one.

When you feel a question is boring one, it most likely that you have not thought of that question. Raising a question is one of the best strategies for creating success and insight.

*ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE REAL QUESTION*

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding. What's the real question? Working on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime.

Continue write/draw untile dead end (Do NOT jump steps, which introduce complexity), otherwise it turns to be thingking randomely about possibilities.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One of the reasons people fail to make innovative solutions is that they have in mind some bias that thing is NOT going to work. So they do NOT explore a possibility.
#+END_QUOTE

When you deal with a challenge you many want to try ALL (EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM) possibilities. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The time you work on a problem is after you are solved it.
#+END_QUOTE

Solve a problem gives you an "insight" which allow you to extend progress even further. A little progress is just an oppotunity to make more. This is one illustration of "Follow the flow of ideas".

The norm (基准) for everything in life (Reality of life) is "under construction" but in "perfect".

* Week 3: Infinity
** A Quick Note
   
Infinity goes beyond what numbers are.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Human beings have had a great triumph (胜利) to find a way to reason about something as vast as infinity.
#+END_QUOTE

It represent one of the prime stategies for effective thinking, which is to look at simple things deeply and see what the consequences are of understanding simple things with such clarity that they propel you into the unknown.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

** A Barrel of Ping Pong Balls

Think the question "Does the following equation the same? $\infty\ne\infty-1$ OR $\infty = \infty - 1$".

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One of the wonderful features about learning new ideas or creating new ideas is struggle and uncertainty and vagueness.
#+END_QUOTE

*Same cardinality* is two collections whose elements can be paired up in to one-to-one correspondence (Each element of one collection matches exactly one element in the other), are said to have the same cardinality(size)

What is the size of a set in mathematic term? It is known as cardinality of the set.

** The Infinity Inn

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One of the MOST productive strategies you will ever learn and ever use in your whole life is to take ideas that worked before and use them again.
#+END_QUOTE

Think about the design pattern example. Use things that you have done before is the best source for creative work.

** How Big Are the Integers?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One of the most important part of solving a challenging question is to understand what the question is.
#+END_QUOTE

The question for this section is "Why the cardinality of the natural numbers the same as the cardinality of all the integers?".

To understand the question above, first have to understand what are *natural numbers*, *integers*, *have the same cardinality*.

| Replace                          | With                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| integers                         | set of numbers {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}                                                             |
| natural numbers                  | set of positive whole numbers {1, 2, 3, ...}                                                               |
| have the same cardinality (基数) | Can be paired up in such a way that each number in one set pairs whith exactly one number in the other set |

The the question become "How to show that set of numbers {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} and set of positive whole numbers {1, 2, 3, ...} can be paired up (Eahc number in one set pairs with exactly one number in the other set)?"

It is important to make every concept is clare before process further. The act of walking through each unfamiliar term get you that much closer to becoming confortable with the question.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When you are working on something that is difficult, retreat back to something that you can do and that you feel confident that you can do.
#+END_QUOTE

Idea does NOT come instantly because all ideas were a struggle (Things alike). People should feel perfectly happy
with the idea of struggling or getting things wrong and then continue working on them and realizing that is part
of the success process. It is incredible contribution to ones life.

** Natural Numbers vs. Rational Numbers

Once again, Failure and mistakes are important positve steps toward success.

The challenge for this section is to proof all naturla number and integers have the same cardinality.

Turns out the natural numbers and the rational numbers have the same cardinality.

* Week 4: Dodgeball
** Dodgeball

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
One of the the things we must do to appreciate our intellectual life is to be open minded, even open minded about things that seem to be absolutedly incomprehensible.
#+END_QUOTE

The game of "Dodgeball", the second player (Player Two) can always win.

** Bigger Dodgeball

The bigger dodgeball game use infinity number of rows, however the player two is still going to win.

The 'buy every ticket' strategy did not work for Player 1. We just saw that Player 2 can always produce a row that is not on Player 1's list.

** Infinity Dodgeball

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It is impossible to create a one-to-one correspondence between all possible sequences of X's and O's.
#+END_QUOTE

'Buy Every Ticket' strategy failed because it was unable to make a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all possible sequences of X's and O's and the row numbers (the natural numbers). 

When it is impossible to make a one-to-one correspondence between two sets, we know that that means that the two sets do not have the same cardinality.

Since we saw conclusively that the set of natural numbers (the row numbers) cannot be put into 1-1 correspondence with the set of all possible sequences of X's and O's, we are forced to conclude that infinity comes in different sizes

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Infinity itself comes in different sizes.
#+END_QUOTE

We can experience unexpected insights that we had never seen before by staing open-minded in the daily life.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
1--0.6????...

2--0.?5???...

3--0.??8??...

4--0.???6??...

...
#+END_SRC

Above snippet shows that the decimal numbers between =0= and =1= has a different cardinality (There is NO one-to-one correspondence) that natural numbers from 1 to infinity.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Old ideas are the richest source for creating new ideas. Rather than creating a whole other proof.
#+END_QUOTE

Turns out there are inifinitely many different sizes of infinity.

* Week 5: Euler Circuit
** Euler Circuit

If you choose any two people, call them A and Z, then you can find a person B who has been in the same room with A, and a person C who has been in the same room as B, and a person D who has been in the same room as C, and and a person E who has been in the same room as D, and a person F who has been in the same room as Z. The theory says you could connect any two people with a chain of 6 or fewer contacts.

The image above is called a *Graph*.

The Six Degrees of Separation is a concept that says every person on earth is connected by six or fewer contacts. 

Degree, the degree of a vertex is the number of edge ends that connect to that vertex. (B in image above have five degrees)

A graph has a Euler circuit means that you can trace the whole graph starting at a vertex, going over each edge exactly once and returning to where you started.

The ONLY place you can get stuck is where you start becuase that is the only which is odd (=even - 1 = odd=).

#+END_QUOTE

* Core Concepts

The following text is copy-paste from the course page (It may not available when you see this).

https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.9.10x+3T2016/courseware/ed583801f1e048b1a5eb5ac21bff383d/16d6d8dbabc344979e1fe4f5946abdf3/

*Understand Deeply*

Don't face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don't know. Then see what's missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notion. There are degrees to understanding (it's not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success.

*Make Mistakes*

Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes are great teachers - they highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding. They also show you which way to turn next, and they ignite your imagination.

*Raise Questions*

Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding. What's the real question? Working on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime. Ideas are in the air - the right questions will bring them out and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible.


*Follow the Flow of Idea*

Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. A new idea is a beginning, not an end. Ideas are rare - milk them. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs.

*The Quintessential Element*

The unchanging element is change - by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning.
