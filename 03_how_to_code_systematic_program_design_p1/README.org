The language used for this course is *Beginning Student Language*.

The detailed syntax guide can be found at link below,

* Introduction
** Welcome

The thing make program hard to write is the poorly formed problem. There are many issues like,

- The task description is incomplete/inconsistent
- Program is too big

Design method break big problem into manageable chunks (Well-chosen smaller pieces). All programmer need to do is to write one part of the program for each small problem which make the result easy to read and modify.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Any program that's actually userful, ends up needing to be modified.
#+END_QUOTE

The goal for this course is learn to write code that is being formed of nice pieces which fit together well, are well tested, and easy to modify.

Systematic program design is to transfer the poorly formed problem to well structured solution.

The techniques learn in this course can be used with any other programming language you may learn in the future. The focuse of this course is the design method rather than language itself.

The first and most important one is (I call this tips Number 0),

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Program design is something you learn by doing
#+END_QUOTE

1. Do not working about making mistakes
2. Try it!
3. Take advantage of discussion
4. Stay caught up
5. Take notes (Focus on the design process, NOT the solution)
6. Work bit by bit every day
7. Always be able to identify what step you are on
8. Ask for help if you stuck for more than 5-10 minutes

The course is targeted to student with no progrmaming experience, so be patient at the beginning.

The learning goals for this module (Copy-paste from course material),

- Be able to write expressions that operate on primitive data including numbers, strings, images and booleans.
- Be able to write constant and function definitions.
- Be able to write out the step-by-step evaluation of simple expressions including function calls.
- Be able to use the stepper to automatically step through the evaluation of an expression.
- Be able to use the Dr Racket help desk to discover new primitives.

** Expressions

To form an expression,

#+BEGIN_SRC 
<value>
(<primitive> <expression> ...)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You can be a very good program designer without knowing a lot of math. Programs in graphics or vision or machine learning where you need to know a lot of math that is because you need to understand that domain.
#+END_QUOTE

** Evaluation

A detailed rules should be understand to understand a big program.

Primitive Call Rule, to evaluate a primitive call,

1. Reduce operands to values
2. Apply primitive to the values

The expression evaluation proceeds from left to right and from inside to outside. 

** Strings and Images

Introduce two primitive values, strings and images.

To form a string,

#+BEGIN_SRC 
"This is a sample string."
#+END_SRC

=string-append= puts two/more string one after others.

=string-lengh= gets the length of the string.

=substring= is similar to =str_var[start:end]= in Python.

=(require 2htdp/image)= is used to show images. 

=above= produces an image with all arguments stacked up and lined up on horizontal centers.

=overlay= produces images on top of the other.

** Constant Definitions

To form a constant definition,

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(define <name> <expression>)
#+END_SRC

Constant definition evaluation rules,

- Evaluate a constant definition: evaluate the expression and record the value as the constant value with the given name
- Evaluate a defined constant name: value is the recorded value

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The notion of defining name constants is going to have a big effect on making our programs comprehensible to other programmers and easy to change in the future.
#+END_QUOTE

** Function Definitions

Function definition rules,

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(define (<function_name> <parameter_name> ...)
  <expression>)
#+END_SRC

Snippet below is a sample function definition in BSL,

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (define (pythag a b)
    (sqrt (+ (sqr a) (sqr b))))
#+END_SRC

Function call expression, 

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(<name-of-defined-function> <expression> ...)

(pythag 3 4)
#+END_SRC

To evaluate function call,

- Reduce operands to values
- Replace function call by body of function in which every occurrence of parameters are replaced by corresponding argument

** Booleans and if Expressions

True/False program is fundamental for computer.

To form an =if= expression,

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(if <expression>  ;; question
    <expression>  ;; true answer
    <expression>  ;; false answer
)
#+END_SRC

The question expression has to produce boolean value to make it a valid =if= expression.

To evaluate an if expression,

- If the question is not a value evaluate it and replace it with a value
  - If the question is true replace entire if expression with true answer expression
  - If the question is false replace entire if expression with false answer expression
  - the question is value other than true or false so produce an error
  
To form a boolean condition expression,

#+BEGIN_SRC 
(and <expression1> <expression2>)

(or <expression1> <expression2>)

(not <expression>)
#+END_SRC

As soon as an expression produces =true=, other expressions to the right of it are NOT evaluated.

** DONE Using the Stepper
   CLOSED: [2016-11-30 Wed 14:15]

Stepper is a debug tool in *DrRacker* which evaluate an expression one step at a time.

** Discovering Primitives

Two methods are commonly used,

1. Guess
2. Search and scroll (Check the documentation)

#+END_QUOTE

* 1b: How to Design Functions
** Module Overview

The learning goals (Copy-paste from course page),

- Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions that operate on primitive data.
- Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements.
- Be able to evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other.
- Be able to evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem.
** Full Speed HtDF Recipe

*HtDF Recipe* stands for /How to Design Function Recipe/, which systematizes the function design process. It makes the process clear and guarantee the function quality.

Design recipe makes hard problem easier, but make the easy problem cumbersome.

The HtDF recipe consists of the following steps,

(1. Signature, purpose and stub
2. Define examples, wrap each in check-expect
3. Template and inventory
4. Code and function body
5. Test and debug until correct

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; 1-1) Signature
  ;; Number -> Number

  ;; 1-2) Purpose
  ;; Produce 2 times the given number

  ;; 1-3) Stub
  (define (double n) 0)

  ;; 2) Examples/tests
  (check-expect (double 3) 6)
  (check-expect (double 4.2) 8.4)

  ;; 3) Template
  ;; (define (double n)
  ;;   (... n))

  ;; 4) Code and function body
  (define (double n)
    (* 2 n))

  ;; 5) All tests pass
#+END_SRC

** Slow Motion HtDF Recipe

Pay attention to each step in the recipe because every step is intented to help with all the steps after it.

*1.1 Signature*

To form a signature,

#+BEGIN_SRC 
Type ... -> Type
#+END_SRC

which declares type of data function consumes and produces. 

*1.2 Purpose*

The purpose is a one line description of what the function produces in term of what it consumes.

*1.3 Stub*

Stub is like piece of scaffolding, which used to avoid function undefined error or alike. It is a function definition,

- Has correct function name
- Has correct number of arguments
- Produces dummy result of correct type

*2 Example/Test*

They help to understand what function must do. Use multiple examples to illustrate behavior. Wrapping in =check-expect= makes them serve as unit tests for completed function.

*3 Template & Inventory*

Template is the function outline.

*4 Code Body*

All previous steps help to know how to complete the function body.

*5 Test and debug*

Run the tests.

** A Simple Practice Example

When function does not work properly, one skill is to scan over the design elements and look for inconsistencies (Often enough to find the bug and make clear what needs to be fixed.).

- Does the purpose match the signature?
- Does the test match the signature and purpose?
- Does the stub match what comes before it?
- Does the function header match the signature and purpose?
- Does the function body match the signature, purpose and tests?

** When Tests are Incorrect

Below is a repeat of *HtDF* process,

*I. Signature, purpose, stub*

The purpose should be more specific than signature. It descripe what the function does, NOT how the function does certain thing.

/Signatures/ type should be as specific as possible.

/Purpose/ should specify how to interpret the output when a function produce a boolean.

*II. Examples (Unit tests)*

- Wrong function definition
- Wrong test
- Both are wrong

Above three (3) circumstances can lead test fails 

Examples/tests are writen after /stub/ is to check if the examples are well-formed.

Code coverage, is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested by a particular test suite. At a minimum, tests should have complete code coverage (No unexecuted code after all tests are run). 

Think of boundary cases (corner cases) when design test cases. Thinking of a new case, or a new subtlety part way through the design is common. When it happens,

- Write a test right aways
- Update all affected part of design (Often involves purpose and/or function difinition)
- Some time also invovles existing tests or signature

*III. Inventory (Template & constants)*
